       Note:
      1. Odd sized chunks are padded at the end with a null byte to ensure
         short word alignment.
      2. The ASAP-defined sub-chunks 'sa  ', 'utt ', 'etic', 'emic', 'tone',   
         'orth', 'mark', 'font', 'spkr', 'lang', 'db  ', 'ref ', 'mdat', 
         'mpl1', 'mpl2', 'mpl3', 'mpl4', and 'mfon' may not immediately follow 
         the 'data' sub-chunk or each other, but if they exist in the WAV file, 
         they must all be present, and in the order given above.  
      3. The version number specified in the 'sa  ' sub-chunk refers to
         the version for the ASAP-defined sub-chunks.  It is the same 
         number indicated in the title of this document and is incremented 
         for each published change.
      4. AnnData consists of the following:
           AnnStringLength   <annotation string length in bytes,          >
                             <excluding null terminator, set by AudioCon  > 
                             <and updated by SA; signed short             >
           AnnString         <annotation string, encoded using font       >
                             <indicated by typeface name in font sub-     > 
                             <chunk and followed by a null byte           > 
                             <terminator (present even if string is zero  > 
                             <length); set by AudioCon and updated/       > 
                             <appended by SA                              >
           PhoneLocUnpacked  <location and duration of phones in          >
                             <uncompressed speech data, present only if   > 
                             <AnnStringLen is nonzero, updated/appended   > 
                             <by AudioCon or SA; for ea. phone in         > 
                             <AnnString, unsigned long byte offset        > 
                             <followed by unsigned long duration (in      > 
                             <bytes)                                      >
           PhoneLocPacked    <location and duration of phones in          >
                             <compressed speech, present only if          > 
                             <AnnStringLen is nonzero and compression     > 
                             <flag set, updated/appended by compression   > 
                             <algorithm, called from AudioCon or SA; for  > 
                             <each phone in AnnString, unsigned long bit  > 
                             <offset into speech data followed by         > 
                             <unsigned long duration in bits              >
         5. The 'mark' sub-chunk may contain any number of waveform markers,
            each consisting of a LabelLength, LabelString, MarkerLocUnpacked, 
            and, if the compression flag is set, MarkerLocPacked.  The # mark 
            is generally used to denote the beginning of a word.  It may be 
            optionally followed by any or all of the following:  a gloss for 
            the word terminated by a null character,  a "pos:" followed by the 
            part-of-speech and a null terminator, and a "ref:" followed by a 
            word level reference terminated by a null.  The LabelLength 
            includes all but the final null terminator.
         6. The 'font' sub-chunk must contain a typeface name for each      
            annotation line.  The names are stored in the sub-chunk as 
            contiguous, variable-length strings, delimited by null byte 
            terminators.  If no font is used (as in the case when a 
            particular annotation string is of zero length), a null 
            terminator is inserted for that typeface name.
         7. The 'db  ' sub-chunk contains dbRegCount dbName parameter
            sets, each of the form indicated above.  
         8. The file attribute must be set to read-only if it contains
            an 'etic', 'emic', 'tone', 'orth', 'mpl1', 'mpl2', 'mpl3',
            or 'mpl4' sub-chunk with a nonzero string length or a 'mark' 
            sub-chunk with a nonzero markChunkSize.  This prevents a wave 
            editor from deleting speech data which may be referenced by the 
            offsets in these sub-chunks.  SA may reset the attribute to read/write 
            momentarily to permit the strings and waveform markers, along 
            with their associated locations and durations, to be updated.
         9. "Set" means initialized once and never modified.
            "Updated" means initialized and thereafter modified in place, 
            as required.  "Appended" means extra data is inserted.
