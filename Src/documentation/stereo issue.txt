Kent,
 
Here is a problem that is caused by SA not allowing the selection of the Waveform when a Stereo file is in use.
Alec disabled this option since SA only shows the Left channel of the stereo file and altering one channel and not the other would cause problems.
My idea for now is to enable Select Waveform (Ctrl-A or using click and drag), but continue to disable the Paste and Cut options. 
It seems that the “Paste as New File” option could be allowed without causing problems.
 
What do you think?
 
Terry 
 
P.S. I suppose the real answer is to alter the hidden Right channel when the Left is changed during a waveform edit.

Dear Terry,
I hope this finds you well.
I am working with speech analyzer to get a phonology and orthography going and am facing a little problem. I can't select or cut anything. 
Ellie Hall took a look and couldn't figure out why. Then she had me send her one of my WAV files, and she couldn't do it on her computer, either. 
So it must be the file, not the program. Do you have any idea what to do?
Thank you for any advice,
Ziggi

Hi again,
Finally realized that we never actually tried the files on MY computer, so I got one from Ziggi and tried it.  
It is a WAV file, but I have the same problems- can’t select a waveform for editing.  So it does seem to be the file (actually quite a lot of them).  
I don’t know that much about file formats, but I think there is maybe really more than one type of WAV file?  
Could it still be a format problem, or perhaps something to do with sampling rates, etc?  
The file I have on my computer is small enough to email if someone would like to look at it.

Ellie

Ellie,
It might be related to the file type. 
I think SA can edit WAV files but might not be able to edit MP3 files. Do you know the audio file type that was being used?
John

Hi,
I don't have any experience with SA myself.  But John Ross or Terry Gibbs may be able to help
Regards,

Hi,
Yesterday I was trying to help Ziggi - she was asking me how to edit an audio file within SA, and I found the reason she couldn’t do it was that the option to select the waveform simply wasn’t available; it was grayed out, and the shortcut keys didn’t work either.  
You could play files normally, but you couldn’t use the editing functions.  
It was set up with XP on a virtual machine (VMWare, I think) on a Macbook Pro.  
I uninstalled it and put her on the most recent version that just came out the other week- same problem.  
Also I checked, and she has the .NET.  
I was wondering if any of you guys here have run into this and might know what is going on, or whether this is something to ask on the LTS list.  
I know we have plenty of Mac users in our group, but not all of them are using SA, and I don’t think they all set up their Windows boxes the same way.  
I put FLEx and Phonology assistant on her machine, and they work fine so far- at least the things we tried.  Do you have any thoughts on this?
Thanks,
Ellie
