SA 3.0.1.5 - 11/1/2011

SA 3.0.1.4 - 10/31/2011
-----------------------

2) Cleanup of CRT_SECURE warnings.  
3) Workaround for ‘SaveAs’ dialog box.  Presently the SaveAs dialog box was crashing when launched by the user because of a Vista/XP compatibility issue.  The offending code was disabled.  The code is now using the WINVER=0x501 define to allow WinXP compatibility.  The problem will be fixed more completely in a later release.
4) Made project (.vcproj) files more consistent.

3) Fix for GPF caused by stack overwrite when creating temporary file name. CreateAuxTempFile was using 'sizeof' function on wide character string.  Probably introduced during Unicode conversion.
