SA 3.0.1.2 - 10/20/2011
-----------------------
1) Fix for F1 Formant issue.  A ULONGLONG value should have been an int.  This was causing data corruption when converted to a double.
2) Fixed F2-F1 graph exception
3) Fixed TaskBar bug - icons not showing.
Disabled musicxml load during opening of document.
4) Fix for gcvt bug
Code was casting char buffer into widechar buffer and corrupt output of gcvt call.
5) Fix for Semitone2Name exception.
6) Merged VS2005 changes to MSEA branch.
  Made minimal changes required to get project to compile in VS2008.


SA 3.0.1.3 - 10/24/2011
-----------------------
1) Converting _stprintf to swprintf_s to remove compiler warnings.
2) Fix for horizontal scrolling bug.  White lines were being displayed when horizontally scrolling zoomed-in window.  Disabled scrolling code - forced repaint of window.
3) Fix for GPF caused by stack overwrite when creating temporary file name. CreateAuxTempFile was using 'sizeof' function on wide character string.  Probably introduced during Unicode conversion.

SA 3.0.1.4 - 10/31/2011
-----------------------
1) ‘MoveStopCursorHere’ feature added to graph popup menu.  This feature allows the user to locate the stop cursor by using the right-click/popup menu on a graph instead of a key-press and a left mouse click.
2) Cleanup of CRT_SECURE warnings.  
3) Workaround for ‘SaveAs’ dialog box.  Presently the SaveAs dialog box was crashing when launched by the user because of a Vista/XP compatibility issue.  The offending code was disabled.  The code is now using the WINVER=0x501 define to allow WinXP compatibility.  The problem will be fixed more completely in a later release.
4) Made project (.vcproj) files more consistent.


SA 3.0.1.5 - 11/1/2011
-----------------------

3) FEATURE: When a top level checkbox is unchecked, the subitems are also unchecked for the Export SFM and Export XML dialog boxes.
4) Cleaned up project files.
5) Reformatted code.
6) Fix for Vista compatibility issue in FileOpen/FileSaveAs dialog boxes.
