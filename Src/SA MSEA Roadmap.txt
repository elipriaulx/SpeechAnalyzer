Tone-to-Gloss National
Change all reference of Tone to Gloss Nat., see email Aug 19
  . Main Menu: Graphs/ Transcription Bars/ Tone
  . Right-Mouse click on a plot:  Transcription Bars/ Tone
  . Tone label in Transcription Bar
  . Main Menu: File/ Export/ (.SFM) (.STF) (.XML) dialog boxes
. Tone is currently tied to each phonetic item (or series of IPA characters as in a single Word).
A Gloss Nat. transcription can only be associated with a Word and not a single IPA character.
So the Tone transcription field now needs to work like the current Gloss transcription field.
Or maybe just hide the Tone transcription field and make a copy of the current Gloss code.

Revision of IPA
1. In File\ Information\ Comments\ Phonetic
Would you put a space character between each Phonetic Word.
Then, for example ChFrench would go from looking like this:
   m??sibuku?tu??lezæmiki¹s??tisio?o?dyi
to:
   m??si buku ? tu?? lez æmi ki¹ s??t isi o?o?dyi

3. Create an SA Export option that would format Wordlist data in SA so it could be imported into LM.
I'm thinking it would use the code that is used for Fieldworks (SFM), but put the data into an LM
project. Then I will ask Russ to make an LM Import feature that can read the SMF file.

4. Enable SA to Open .au and .ogg files

5. Enable SA to directly open 24-bit recordings

. show a chart of the ‘frequency of occurrence’ of Vowels and Consonants in the current file.

. show a chart of the ‘frequency of occurrence’ chart from a composite of several files.

. show a chart of all Vowel lengths.

. show a chart of the Pitch of all vowels.

. play a Video file in a child window, and extract the audio for phonetic analysis.
