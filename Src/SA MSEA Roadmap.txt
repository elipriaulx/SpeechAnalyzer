   m??sibuku?tu??lezæmiki¹s??tisio?o?dyi
to:
   m??si buku ? tu?? lez æmi ki¹ s??t isi o?o?dyi

3. Create an SA Export option that would format Wordlist data in SA so it could be imported into LM.
I'm thinking it would use the code that is used for Fieldworks (SFM), but put the data into an LM
project. Then I will ask Russ to make an LM Import feature that can read the SMF file.

4. Enable SA to Open .au and .ogg files

5. Enable SA to directly open 24-bit recordings

. show a chart of the ‘frequency of occurrence’ of Vowels and Consonants in the current file.

. show a chart of the ‘frequency of occurrence’ chart from a composite of several files.

. show a chart of all Vowel lengths.

. show a chart of the Pitch of all vowels.

. play a Video file in a child window, and extract the audio for phonetic analysis.

6. Add control the the split file feature to allow user to disable or enable export of phrase segments.
