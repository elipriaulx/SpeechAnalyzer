1) Enable resume of Playback after pressing SpaceBar to Pause, by pressing the SpaceBar a 2nd time to continue.

2) In File\ Information\ Comments\ Phonetic      
Put a space character between each Phonetic Word.

     m??sibuku?tu?lezæmiki¹s?~tisio?o?dyi
to looking like this:
     m??si buku ? tu? lez æmi ki¹ s?~t isi o?o?dyi

In order to reduce the complexity for new users I'd like to not immediately show everything. That is,
hide some of the option, and only  show Waveform and Pitch, then show Spectrum, then Formants.
Clicking on Music would work as usual and come up to just below Phonetic and hide everything else:

Hide four buttons on the Standard Toolbar.

The default setting in Tools/ Options... for 'Advanced Tools' should be for it to be unchecked.


5) Implement the color ideas and now include Gloss Nat.

*Some Day************************************************

1. Create an SA Export option that would format Wordlist data in SA so it could be imported into LM.
I'm thinking it would use the code that is used for Fieldworks (SFM), but put the data into an LM
project. Then I will ask Russ to make an LM Import feature that can read the SMF file.

2. Enable SA to Open .au and .ogg files

3. Enable SA to directly open 24-bit recordings

. show a chart of the ‘frequency of occurrence’ of Vowels and Consonants in the current file.

. show a chart of the ‘frequency of occurrence’ chart from a composite of several files.

. show a chart of all Vowel lengths.

. show a chart of the Pitch of all vowels.

. play a Video file in a child window, and extract the audio for phonetic analysis.

4. Add control the the split file feature to allow user to disable or enable export of phrase segments.
