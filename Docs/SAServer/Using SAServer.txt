Use Of Speech Analyzer Server by other applications:

Prolog:
Speech Analyzer comes in following  flavors:
* SA.exe which is the 16-bit version of the program.
* SA2.exe which is the 32-bit version of the program.
* Speech Analyzer.ocx which is a COM object for use in FieldWorks.
* SAServer.exe which can only open files using scripting commands. 
  The 16-bit and 32-bit version of the program have the same name.


First:
Try a 'simple' test.

Included are the following files:
* a Wave file for testing use (TEST.WAV).
* a List file that contains scripting steps for SAServer to follow (DEMO.LST).
* a copy of the List file for backup use, I'll explain why below (A-DEMO.LST).
* a Command Line for use in the Run command DOS box (CMD-LINE.TXT).

Install the Speech Tools or use the included SAServer program as a test.

Now copy the 4 files noted above to C:\Temp
Also copy SAServer.exe to C:\Temp

Next open the 'Cmd-Line.txt' file and copy and paste the text into 'Open:' in the
Windows 'START/Run' command. Then click OK and this should launch SAServer, then open 'Test.wav' and position SAServer at the right-hand edge of the screen showing a Pitch contour.


If this works, then close SAServer by clicking on the X in the upper-hand corner. You will get a message that the CallingApp can't be found (that's ok, later-on it will be your application) Note that 'Demo.lst' has been deleted by SAServer. Make a copy of the 'A-Demo.lst' file and rename it to 'Demo.lst' in order to rerun the test if desired.


Second:
If this works, then we need to talk about the real use of SAServer.

The actual call to run SAServer is based on the version and location of the Speech Tools. The possibilities are:

C:\Program Files\Speech Tools\SA\SAServer\SAServer.exe
     (if the Speech Tools on Word&Deed is used)
or

C:\Program Files\Speech Tools\IPA-Help\SAS\SAServer.exe
     (if the free 16-bit Speech Tools version is used)



Also, included is file called COMM-SA-final-Corrected.Doc file which gives
detailed information on how to script SA to do things. Note that the command-line
positioning option is no longer used and you must use the 'command#=DisplayPlot' option in the script (as is shown in the Demo.lst file above).
